# CameoParison Svelte App

The game is called CameoParison, and the goal is to guess which celebrities are expensive, and which ones are cheap. Since there's no official API, we'll grab data from [cameo-explorer.netlify.app](https://cameo-explorer.netlify.app/celebs/), which contains a scraped snapshot of some of the top celebs.
